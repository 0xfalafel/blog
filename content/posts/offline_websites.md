> Tips and tricks to navigate an offline world

I travel as much as possible by __train__ ðŸš‚.

One of the thing that I _enjoy_ the most about traveling by train is that I can use my computer during that time. Instead of looking at the car window for 5 hours straight.

Despite missing an major [medition](dr K) oportunity. __I can code__ and play CTF during that time.

The major pain point it that almost anything you do on a computer require the Internet. So bellow are a list of things that I have started to do 


## Take the websites you need with you

You 

```bash
wget --mirror -p --convert-links -P website-copy https://ratatui.rs/
```

```bash
python3 -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1
```

Script

## Download youtube videos



## Use local LLM as a stackoverflow replacement



## Spotify offline


## Movies

https://wifi.sncf/



## Restriction of Wifis

## Play CTFs

## Conclusion

I started to do all theses things over time. While intialy I disliked being offline. Now I find that having a reduced number of distraction (no youtube, hacker news.), makes for a really productive time.

I have made larges improvements to [hextazy](https://github.com/0xfalafel/hextazy) while being on the train. And also written this blog post.
