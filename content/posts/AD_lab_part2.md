> Install the Domain Controller.

## Introduction

This is __2nd article__ of a 3 part series.

* part 1: [Create a Windows Server 2022 VM with vagrant.](/posts/ad_lab_part1/)
* part 2: [Install the Domain Controller.](https://t.ly/ptO4n)
* part 3: [Add some misconfigurations](https://t.ly/ptO4n), and test them with netexec.


In the [previous article](/posts/ad_lab_part1/) we have created a __Windows Server 2022__ virtual machine using `vagrant`.

Now we are going to **install the _Domain Controller_** with `powershell`.


## Current configuration

If you have followed the previous article, your `Vagrantfile` should look like this:

```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # Base box image
  config.vm.box = "StefanScherer/windows_2022"

  # Configure a name for the VM
  config.vm.hostname = "dc01"
  config.vm.define "dc01"

  # Change the name in Virtualbox
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.name = "dc01"
  end

  # Add a static IP on a Host-only network
  IP = "10.0.0.4"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: IP
end
```

## Provisioning

In `vagrant`, _provisioning_ is the action of configuring your server.

We have multiple possibilites to do this:

* shell scripts
* ansible
* chef
* etc

### Why _powershell_ and not _ansible_

I had some bad experiencies with _ansible_, some years ago, were I did write a script to apply some CIS configuration. And ended up loosing a lot of time.

I thank _ansible_ is really awesome when you have to configure a lot of servers. But for configuring a 1 or 4 servers, I prefer to stick to a simple script.  

It also makes things a bit easier to deploy in our case.

Use what makes you happy ðŸ™‚.  
But since a lot of AD labs are made using ansible, I thought it would be interesting to explain why we didn't go that way.

### Okay, actual provisioning please !

Yep !
